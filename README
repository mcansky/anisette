== Welcome to Anisette

Welcome to Anisette. Ok the name is in french, probably ridicule and laughable but, eh who cares ? If this thing ever goes into production in one company and that one guy has to say, in english, that name to his manager to explain that it's a needed tool well, just for that one time I might be really happy :)


What this thing does : the purpose is to have a quick thing to see the last commits on git trees, post bugs and have a nice overview of both commits and bugs. It supports also the fix, fixes and close keywords in commit messages to automaticly close bugs.

* commit pull : using rake git:pull the app pulls the commits of all the projects and branches registered. you can use PNAME=fooproject to only pull commits from the fooproject project. carefull : only gets the 100 last commits
* commit purge : using rake git:purge : purge the db of all the commits
* display projects list
* display last commits and bugs for one project
* display details of bug
* display details of commit (including the linked diff)
* creation of bugs


=== Install :

it's a rails app : use your usual railsapp setup thing (or check the interweb if you don't know). You also need the following gems : grit, coderay.
you need to create a user : http://url/register
after that check the / page and create a new project.
